# Airbnb Data Analysis — Summary

This project analyzes Airbnb listing data to understand pricing patterns, customer engagement, and neighbourhood trends.

## Data Collection & Cleaning
- Dataset includes room type, price, reviews, availability, and location details.  
- Cleaned missing values (e.g., `reviews_per_month`, `last_review`) and removed duplicates for consistent analysis.

## Data Analysis
- Generated descriptive statistics for price and reviews.  
- Explored how room type, neighbourhood, and other features influence pricing.  
- Examined correlations among numerical variables such as price, availability, and reviews.

## Visualizations
- Histograms, scatter plots, and other charts used to show distribution and relationships.  
- Geospatial maps created to display listing density across neighbourhoods.

## Trend Insights
- Identified price variations by neighbourhood and room type.  
- Analyzed patterns in review frequency and availability across time.

## Key Findings
- Location strongly impacts listing price.  
- Room type influences occupancy and review activity.  
- Certain features (neighbourhood, availability, review rate) heavily affect pricing and host performance.
